  abstract={Hybrid crafts are increasingly repurposing the metal materials used in hand crafts for their conductive and interactive affordances. In this paper, we look to the history of metal threads and their use in the fine craft of bobbin lace to explore tensions and opportunities for leveraging bobbin lace techniques with e-textile crafting. First, we contribute an overview of the history of metal thread use in bobbin lace practices. Second, we provide insights on contemporary bobbin lace culture from individual interviews with 17 bobbin lacemakers. Third, to better understand how to integrate e-textiles with bobbin lace practices, we engaged in a Research-through-Design process of creating e-textile bobbin lace patterns and samples alongside two group feedback sessions with members of a bobbin lace guild. Together, these three contributions provide an introduction of the affordances and constraints of bobbin lace as a unique fabrication method for e-textile hand crafts.},
